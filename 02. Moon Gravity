// The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth.
Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight W(as a floating-point number) on the Earth.
The weight W should be read from the console. //

using System;
class Moon
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        float W = float.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        float WMoon = W * 0.17f;
        Console.WriteLine("{0:0.000}", WMoon);
    }
}
